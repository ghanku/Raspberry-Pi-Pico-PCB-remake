# Raspberry Pi Pico remake
This project is recreation of the Raspberry Pi Pico PCB ([see link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)) using Altium. the main goal was to learn professional PCB design in Altium and to adapt to the chip shortage by using alternative parts.

## PCB Production
If you want to build this board please use the gerbers located in [/PCB Manufacturing](https://github.com/ghanku/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-PCB-remake/tree/main/PCB%20Manufacturing). 

Note that the Design Rules used were from [ayberkozgur](https://github.com/ayberkozgur/jlcpcb-design-rules-stackups) together with a standard 4 Layer Stackup with minimums set to JLCPCBs capabalities.

## SMT Assembly
If you want to Assemble this board at a professional Assembly house please use the BOM and Pick and Place files located in [/Board Assembly](https://github.com/ghanku/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-PCB-remake/tree/main/Board%20Assembly).
